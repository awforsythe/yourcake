You Can't Eat Your Cake and Have It Too
=======================================

This repository houses the source code for an [old puzzle platform game](http://awforsythe.com/old/?p=cake) that I created in C++ for a one-month game development contest. As it was created in 2010, it's not representative of my current programming style of C++ proficiency. I hope to be able to fix it up here as a mean of making the source code slightly less embarassing.

Dependencies
------------

This version of the project is built with Visual Studio 2010 and is configured for both Win32 and x64 architectures. For the sake of convenience, preconfigured versions of all the external libraries are included in the repo. To build these libraries, open a Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt in yourcake/dep, and run `build`. Running `clean` will erase all library and object files after a build.
